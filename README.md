Description       : This project has been developed to enable easier observation of hard-to-reach areas. It includes a camera, 2 DC Motors for
                    rover movement, and 2 servo motors for adjusting the camera angle. Communication is achieved via TCP/IP, with the rover
                    operating as a client. Users can control the rover using an Android device with the specially developed Android application
                    for this project. This project is part of the graduation project for the Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department at
                    Eskişehir Osmangazi University.
